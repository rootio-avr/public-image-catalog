# <img src="./assets/Asset 3.png" alt="drawing" width="30"/> Public Images Catalog
This is a public catalog of common Images maintained by [root.io](https://root.io). Root maintains free, low-vulnerability container images for DevSecOps teams. Fix vulnerabilities in your images or ours in minutes with Automated Vulnerability Remediation (AVR).
You can also see and search our images in our [Image Catalog](https://images.root.io/)
